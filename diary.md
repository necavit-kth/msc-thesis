Looking at PhD positions at ICTA (UAB), they seem to have a research line about Ecological Economics (EE). Perhaps an EE approach for the thesis (in the economic evaluation step of the model or the policy design phase) could provide insights and novel perspectives to the model. Moreover, it could be a lever to help get into the PhD programme at ICTA (UAB).

Rajib sends an email with a MSc thesis proposal:

```
I have a master thesis project idea. The project is system dynamics or agent based modeling transport and energy efficiency. Recently I am involved in a project that is aiming to determine how behavioral intervention programs should be designed to be as effective as possible in order to achieve sustainable and energy-efficient travel mode choices. The preliminary idea of the master thesis is to make scenario analysis to test policy intervention towards energy-efficient travel model choices.

Answer to Rajib:

Hi Rajib!

Thank you very much for contacting me about this; it seems like a project I would very much like to join! I actually have been thinking in doing something similar for my thesis. So far, I have been talking to Markus Robért about the thesis supervision, because the very first idea I had was to integrate my work with the CERO framework. However, I now have several ideas that stem from the original one, which are much more aligned with what you suggest. I guess we could arrange a co-supervision or simply a collaboration, in case we are interested in it and we are allowed to do so.

I am attaching a thesis proposal that I had to craft for the Research Methodology and Theory of Science course. As you can see, the idea I had was to keep working with the causal loop diagram (system dynamics) model that we have developed in Applied Industrial Ecology and to integrate it with the CERO framework, somehow. After that, I thought that it could also be integrated with other models dealing with travel demand and traffic assignment (as Robért and Jonsson (2006) did with SAMPERS and EMME2, for example).

Furthermore, I also thought on adding an Ecological Economics approach to all the concepts and analysis of the economic "side" of the model. Besides being more in line with sustainability and resource/energy constrained market mechanisms, it would be a worthy addition if I was to apply for a PhD position in Barcelona, at the ICTA institute (http://www.uab.cat/web/postgraduate/phds/all-phd-programmes/research-and-supervision/lines-of-research-and-thesis-supervision/environmental-science-and-technology-1345467765236.html?param2=1345658967920).

Could you provide me with more information about the project you are involved in? This way, I could think about how to integrate or change my thesis topic.
