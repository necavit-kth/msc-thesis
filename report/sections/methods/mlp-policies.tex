Regarding the ultimate goal of deriving policy recommendations (Obj. 4 in \sref{s:intro:aim-objectives}), no particular welfare (economic) assessment tool was used. The recommendations are general guidelines, not specific numbers on environmental taxes, for example, thus the decision to avoid using a formal economic method was taken. However, the policies are \emph{informed} by the transition studies perspective, which integrates the results of the backcasting process (the transition pathway) and the analysis of the feedback structures in the current mobility system through the use of CLDs.

The integration of the rest of the results through a transitions perspective was done by analysing those same insights through a different discourse. The formal method used for rising the CLD and backcasting outcomes to the same discursive level is the so called Multi-Level Perspective (MLP). This analytical framework defines three levels that characterise a socio-technical system. These levels are associated with micro, meso and macro perspectives \parencite{geels2001_Technologicaltransitionsas,rotmans2001_Moreevolutionthan}:
\begin{enumeratealpha}
\item The socio-technical \emph{niche} level, at the most microscopic level of the system, is the location where radical innovation occurs. Several processes occur within the niches: the articulation of expectations (visions), the construction of stakeholder networks and learning on different dimensions (organisational, policy, technological, etc.) \parencite{geels2012_MultiLevelPerspective}.
\item The socio-technical \emph{regime} level is situated at the mesoscopic level. It is the virtual space formed by all the actors within a socio-technical system, their shared practices, rules and cultures. Infrastructure supporting the socio-technical system, as well as regulation, and technology belong to the regime level too. In the case of regimes, innovation is not radical. Instead, it is incremental and rather slow, following a pattern of ``dynamic stability''. Resilience is, thus, a key characteristic of regimes \parencite{geels2012_MultiLevelPerspective}.
\item The socio-technical landscape, at the macroscopic level, is the context in which both regimes and niches are embedded. Ideologies, culture, value hierarchies, beliefs, macroeconomic trends, the media, governance systems, etc. belong to this level. The landscape shapes, through pressures and support relations, the regimes and the niches. A characteristic of this level is the slow changes it suffers: regimes come and go, even more so niches, but it can take several decades or even centuries for change in the landscape to become apparent \parencite{rotmans2001_Moreevolutionthan,kemp2007_Transitionmanagementas,geels2012_MultiLevelPerspective}.
\end{enumeratealpha}

The MLP allows for a multi-dimensional analysis of mobility, because it deals with more than just technologies (or any other aspect of the system: economics, environmental impacts, regulation, etc.). This is ideal to overcome the limitations in scope of traditional transport research. The MLP also addresses structural change by analysing how socio-technical innovations fight for dominance against established regimes. Structural change is an important element in transitions that no previous mobility research (or policy) approach has dealt with before. The MLP also stresses the importance of the patterns of co-evolution between the landscape and regimes and niches. In particular, the MLP (and transitions studies in general) addresses the dynamics of stability and change of regimes and niches \parencite{geels2011_multilevelperspective}. This specific feature of the MLP serves very well the aim of the thesis of understanding why mobility presents policy resistance and what can be done to tackle it.

Finally, the way in which the MLP was used in the thesis is as follows: the backcasted changes that conform the transition pathway were described in terms of the MLP approach. The feedback mechanisms that cause policy resistance in today's mobility system were incorporated to the description, also translated into the language of the MLP. Thus, the narration of the transition path contains normative elements stemming from the backcast and a dynamic analysis of the forces that can hinder the transition. This MLP-inspired analysis was used to design a set of policy recommendations that focuses on the long term goals and on breaking the stability of the system that poses as an obstacle to the transformation of the system.
