\todowarning{Where should this be?}
Travelling is discouraged by governments through economic policy instruments such as carbon and/or congestion taxes, road usage fees and by shifting investments and subsidies from private mobility schemes to public ones. Fuel subsidies have progressively been reduced or abandoned, road building has come to a halt, in favour of enhanced public transport infrastructure (rail networks, bus lanes, etc.) and public transport fees are now heavily subsidized, instead of investing these resources in automobility fleet renewal programmes or in facilitating the operation of the automobility industry.

Regarding aviation, economic incentives for low-cost trips have been reduced; the market has been regulated and stringent regulations on emissions and other indirect impacts have been put in place.
