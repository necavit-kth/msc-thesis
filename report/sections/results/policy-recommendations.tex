\subsection{Niche level policies}
\label{ss:results:policies_niche}
\todoparagraph{Encourage niche formation with two goals: (1) provide funding for potential breakthrough technological changes and (2) promote counter-cultural movements that challenge the regime}

\todoparagraph{Niche formation is difficult to predict, therefore specific policies are absurd to describe in here.}

\subsection{Regime level policies}
\label{ss:results:policies_regime}
\todoparagraph{Policies: (1) finish the ``good relationship'' with the automotive industry, (2) stop subsidising fuels, (3) stop subsidising car fleet renewal schemes, (4) introduce congestion taxes in urban areas, (5) change urban development patterns, through regulation and changes in the education system (for planners in the making), (6) more stringent regulation on emmissions, (7) invest in public transportation development: accessibility, reliability, frequency, much higher subsidies, etc.}

\subsection{Landscape level policies}
\label{ss:results:policies_landscape}
\todoparagraph{Targeted at higher levels of policy-making? National and supra-national, perhaps}
\todoparagraph{Carbon taxes. Import taxes for automobiles. Aviation regulation. International high-speed railway networks. Electric grids integration. Renewable energy (electricity) generation. Fossil fuel phase-out. Push for biofuels: regulation? International cooperation and collaboration; technological transfer. Integrated policies across countries.}
