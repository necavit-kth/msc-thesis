The SSP1-MOB vision of the future described in \sref{s:results:ssp1-mob} is used in the following sections to synthesise the changes that the mobility paradigm must undergo\footnote{The changes are not ``suffered'' by an autonomous and disconnected system of mobility, but are introduced by all the agents that play a part in it: users, industries, governments, decision makers, researchers, planners, etc.} to reach the desired form. The synthesis is done using backcasting approach, for which an ``intermediate step'' is presented in \ssref{ss:results:backcasting-2050-intermediate-step}. This halfway step is described in terms of the same variables highlighted in \tref{t:ssp1-mob-2100-narrative-thesis}, but adding information for the year 2050. The baseline ``scenario'' status of 2017 is also provided in \ssref{ss:results:backcasting-2050-intermediate-step}. The changes between the 2100 and 2050 storylines, along with the ones between the 2050 narrative and the baseline are then provided in \ssref{ss:results:backcasting-the-path}.

\subsection{SSP1-MOB 2050: an intermediate step to sustainable mobility}
\label{ss:results:backcasting-2050-intermediate-step}
In order to ease the identification of changes and trends within the backcasting process of \ssref{ss:results:backcasting-the-path}, an intermediate step for the year 2050 is developed and displayed in \tref{t:ssp1-mob-2050-narrative-thesis}. The comparison table contains the variables for the 2100, 2050 and 2017 (baseline) years. With regards to the baseline, numerous data sources have been consulted, with as high as possible quality standards. The list of sources mainly consists of databases from global agencies or multinational regions, like the International Energy Agency (IEA) or the European Commission (EC). \todonote{Should this be in the Methods chapter?}Even though there are some inconsistencies regarding the data collection years, the range is considerably limited: only data from 2005 is considered. However thorough the baseline data research was, some variables were actually assumed to have some (qualitative) value, which is generally aligned with the insights that authors dealing with sustainable mobility provide. \todonote{Is the following true for \textbf{all} variables??}For all those variables where an estimation was infeasible or supporting data was unavailable, an ``assumed'' label is displayed.

\subsection{The backcasted path to SSP1-MOB}

\todoparagraph{Quick description (table? itemize?) of the changes occurring between the 2050 narrative and 2017 baseline.}
\todoparagraph{Explain and contextualise all the backcasted changes: what is the main path to the sustainable future mobility paradigm?}
As already highlighted in the \sref{ss:results:ssp1-mob-paradigm}, one of the key preconditions for the transition to a sustainable mobility paradigm is a change in the \emph{cultural perception} of mobility (how is it understood). This shift of cultural perspective happens not only at the user level, but also at the urban/traffic planner one. \textcite{banister2008_sustainablemobilityparadigm}, drawing from \textcite{marshall2001_challengesustainabletransport}, presents some of the foundation stones of the change to the sustainable mobility paradigm, with which the SSP1-MOB narrative is aligned, and also provides some insight into the cultural contrasts between such a paradigm and the current mobility culture:
%
\begin{enumeratealpha}
\item Instead of speeding up traffic, slowing down traffic is the new target for both users and planners.
\item Streets are seen as a space for urban life, rather than just public spaces occupied by private automobiles only.
\item Social and environmental multicriteria analyses regarding mobility are performed in addition the already dominant economic assessments.
\item Larger travel times become acceptable, in contrast to the current ever accelerating pace of society and mobility.
\item Attention is shifted from vehicles to people: human, personal mobility is the core of the frame, opposed to just vehicle mobility.
\end{enumeratealpha}
