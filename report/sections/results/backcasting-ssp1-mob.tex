The SSP1-MOB vision of the future described in \sref{s:results:ssp1-mob} is used in the following sections to synthesise the changes that the mobility paradigm must undergo\footnote{The changes are not ``suffered'' by an autonomous and disconnected system of mobility, but are introduced by all the agents that play a part in it: users, industries, governments, decision makers, researchers, planners, etc.} to reach the desired form. The synthesis is done using backcasting approach, for which an ``intermediate step'' is presented in \ssref{ss:results:backcasting-2050-intermediate-step}, by showing the state of the same fundamental SSP1-MOB variables, but for the year 2050. The changes between the 2100 and 2050 storylines, along with the ones between the 2050 narrative and the current situation (2017) are then provided in \ssref{ss:results:backcasting-the-path}

\subsection{SSP1-MOB 2050: an intermediate step to sustainable mobility}
\label{ss:results:backcasting-2050-intermediate-step}
In order to ease the backcasting process in \ssref{ss:results:backcasting-the-path}, an intermediate step or ``state'' is developed herein to stress the changes in the trends identified in \ssref{ss:results:ssp1-mob-development}. To summarise the state of the variables and trends, already presented for SSP1-MOB, in the year 2050, a comparison table is provided in \tref{t:ssp1-mob-2050-narrative-thesis}. Both 2100 and 2050 desired states for sustainable mobility are shown side-by-side.

\todoparagraph{Explain and contextualise all the backcasted changes: what is the main path to the sustainable future mobility paradigm?}
As already highlighted in the \sref{ss:results:ssp1-mob-paradigm}, one of the key preconditions for the transition to a sustainable mobility paradigm is a change in the \emph{cultural perception} of mobility (how is it understood). This shift of cultural perspective happens not only at the user level, but also at the urban/traffic planner one. \textcite{banister2008_sustainablemobilityparadigm}, drawing from \textcite{marshall2001_challengesustainabletransport}, presents some of the foundation stones of the change to the sustainable mobility paradigm, with which the SSP1-MOB narrative is aligned, and also provides some insight into the cultural contrasts between such a paradigm and the current mobility culture:
%
\begin{enumeratealpha}
\item Instead of speeding up traffic, slowing down traffic is the new target for both users and planners.
\item Streets are seen as a space for urban life, rather than just public spaces occupied by private automobiles only.
\item Social and environmental multicriteria analyses regarding mobility are performed in addition the already dominant economic assessments.
\item Larger travel times become acceptable, in contrast to the current ever accelerating pace of society and mobility.
\item Attention is shifted from vehicles to people: human, personal mobility is the core of the frame, opposed to just vehicle mobility.
\end{enumeratealpha}
