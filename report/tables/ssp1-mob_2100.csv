"Variable or feature","State"
"Development scenario",
"Societal sustainability awareness","High"
"Total travel demand (Tpkm/yr)","Higher than the baseline (2017)"
"Travel demand per capita (Tpkm/yr)","Lower than the baseline (2017)"
"Land use (urban development)",
"Urban density","High (higher than 2017 baseline)"
"Land use patterns","Mixed-use development paradigm"
"Economic centralisation","Medium; cities are hotspots, but jobs are spread amongst them"
"City sizes","Medium; avoidance of megacities or (sub)urban sprawl"
"Travel modes share",
"Intermodal travel","Facilitated, high acceptancy and usage"
"Public transport (rail, bus, aviation)","Majority of demand supply; much higher than the baseline (2017)"
"Automobility (private vehicles)","Still relevant, but much lower than the baseline (2017)"
"Slow modes (walking and cycling)","Higher than the baseline (2017)"
"Cultural perception",
"Mobility","Accessibility, local in scale, slowed down, managed, reasonable travel time and reliability, integrated"
"Public transport","Public mobility as a reliable, comfortable, enjoyable and accessible service"
"Automobility","Automobility as a utility to serve a special need"
"Public transport",
"Reliability","High"
"Consumer cost","Low"
"Accessibility","High"
"Safety","High"
"Public transport infrastructure investments","High and continuous"
"Automobility",
"Reliability","High"
"Consumer cost","High"
"Accessibility","High (especially in rural or remote areas)"
"Safety","High (higher risk than public transport)"
"Automobility infrastructure investments (roads, fuel stations, etc.)","Low to medium; maintenance covers the majority of the investments; capacity is not increased"
"Fuel technology",
"Automobiles","Battery electric vehicles for short-medium ranged trips; hydrogen fuelled for long range"
"Rail","Full electrification of the network"
"Bus","Electric or hydrogen-fuelled"
"Aviation","Renewable biofuels"
