\chapter{Results}
\label{c:results}

The \gls{IPCC} has recently developed several scenarios that are the basis of their integrated assessments \parencite{oneill2017_roadsaheadNarratives,vuuren2017_Energylanduse,fricko2017_markerquantificationShared,fujimori2017_SSP3AIMimplementation,calvin2017_SSP4worlddeepening,kriegler2017_Fossilfueleddevelopment}. These scenarios are called \glspl{SSP} and are defined on the basis of qualitative narratives that contain all the necessary information on global trends to enable a further quantification step, using \glspl{IAM}, such as the IMAGE model \parencite{vuuren2017_Energylanduse}. Given that \glspl{SSP} are not design solely for the purpose of climate change studies, but are rather a description of world futures, they can be used in other disciplines and, particularly, in any kind of sustainability studies \parencite{oneill2017_roadsaheadNarratives}. Such an extension of one of the scenarios is provided in \autoref{s:results:ssp1-mob}, regarding developmental paths of mobility.

\section{SSP1-MOB: a mobility extension of SSP1}
\label{s:results:ssp1-mob}

Among the \glspl{SSP} scenarios, SSP1 ``Sustainability -- Taking the green road'' is the one that implies a lower level of both adaptation and mitigation challenges, with respect to climate change. Moreover, it is the one that is more aligned with the concept of \gls{SD}, due to its relatively high performance in all three pillars of sustainability: environmental conservation, social and economic sustainability (at least, economic \textit{growth} per capita). Therefore, it is the selected \gls{SSP} to extend to cover the mobility sector, in order to perform the backcasting process that will be used to identify the necessary changes and development goals to reach a sustainable transport system in the future.

The extension of the scenario is called \gls{SSP1-MOB} and is also developed through a qualitative narrative, in which a \textit{vision} of a future sustainable mobility system is outlined. The features and trends of said vision are summarised in \autoref{t:ssp1-mob-narrative-vars}. The following is the narrated version of the \gls{SSP1-MOB} scenario, describing the global situation of the mobility system in the year 2100:

\blockquote{Driven by an increasing awareness level of environmental and socio-economic impacts of the transportation system, the world has adopted a series of changes to reduce those. Vehicles have become more efficient, liquid hydrocarbon fuels are less carbon intensive and renewable (based on biofuels), but there has also been a major shift in travel modes and, most importantly, total demand\marginpar{\footnotesize Travel demand is calculated as travelled kilometres per person and year.} per capita has been reduced. However, the global total travel demand has increased, due to economic growth and increases in the living standard of countries in Africa, Asia and South America.

Most of the travel demand is supplied through \gls{PT}, be it in the form of passenger rail, buses or aviation. An increased and continuous heavy investment in \gls{PT} infrastructure (an extensive railway network, for example) has enabled fast, secure and low-carbon transport options for the majority of the population, which lives in more concentrated urban areas. High speed trains cover the demand for regional and national trips and even international trips (whenever the distance is not excessive), while regular trains are the main mode of transport for commuters and interurban travellers. Efficient, bio-fuelled, hybrid and electric buses are used for relatively short trips within cities or to connect less accessible and remote areas. Aviation is used primarily for international travel, but the economic incentives for low-cost trips have been reduced; the market has been regulated and stringent regulations on emissions and other indirect impacts have been put in place.

Even though \gls{PT} is the main mode of transport, private mobility (automobility) is still a relevant mode in terms of total travel demand. Electric cars are the main car-based technological alternative used for short to medium ranged trips, such as commuting, while hydrogen-fuelled vehicles take the lead for longer trip distances. The main reason for the long term survival of this mode is the higher degree of accessibility it provides, especially in remote urban areas or in the rural landscape. While accessibility is kept at a high level due to the possibility to use this private transport mode, car sharing is common and most urban communities benefit from reduced fleets thanks to carpooling, which is also commonly available and well accepted by the public. The cultural perception of the car as a status symbol has decreased, in favour of the more environmentally sustainable \gls{PT} and cycling and walking. Also, the discourse of freedom that once legitimised the use of the car has been challenged and highly contested, due to an increasing realisation that car-based mobility causes not only air pollution, but socio-economic impacts ranging from congestion to a dehumanization of the urban space.

An increase in urban density (1), a change in land use patterns (2) and a de-centralisation of economic development hotspots (3) are at the core of the substantial change in travellers' needs and, thus, behaviour. More concentrated urban centres allow for a shortening of trip lengths, up to a point where cycling and walking are feasible alternatives. The size of cities, however, is kept below certain thresholds that permit, in principle, for a more livable and sustainable way of life. This indeed means that a de-centralisation process has taken place, from huge, unwieldy metropolis to medium-sized cities, allowing for (and requiring) a more horizontal economic and governance structure. Moreover, there has been a generalised backlash against single-use urban development, this is, there has been a move towards mixing cultural, residential, work, institutional and commercial uses. This form of urban development acknowledges the limitations of single-use schemes, such as isolation and automobility dependence. These de-centralisation and mixing trends allow people to avoid the need for relocation to find a job or, for the same matter, commute long distances. Instead, short to medium distances or travel times are the norm when commuting, thus preventing the further need and use of automobiles.

Walking and cycling are increasingly adopted by many to cover very short or inner-urban trips, especially amongst the youngest. Cycling lanes are an integral part of every urban area road network and public cycling facilities, such as parking stations, are commonplace. Traffic regulation is changed to prioritise and ensure the safety of both cyclists and pedestrians. Ample footpaths (sidewalks) provide not only the space for walking but also a more ``livable'' urban environment.\todo{Is this too ``micro''? The level of detail is way higher than in the other paragraphs!}
