\chapter{Results}
\label{c:results}

This chapter presents the main results in a logical succession, corresponding with the objectives defined in the \nameref{s:intro:need-for-transition} section. The development of the vision of a future sustainable mobility system is given in \autoref{s:results:ssp1-mob}. In \autoref{s:results:backcasting-ssp1-mob}, this vision is used as the basis of a backcasting process to determine the necessary changes to achieve the sustainable mobility paradigm. \autoref{s:results:autolock-model} presents a conceptual model to build insights on the current state of the automobility system with respect to its dynamics of change and stability. These dynamics are put in opposition to the necessary changes derived in the backcasting process, to discuss long-term policy recommendations in \autoref{s:results:policy-recommendations}.
