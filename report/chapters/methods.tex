\chapter{Methods}
\label{c:methods}

This chapter provides with an overview of the methodological framework (the combination of methods) used to achieve the stated \nameref{s:intro:aim-objectives} in each of the following sections. \sref{s:methods:vision} deals with the sustainable mobility vision development. The requirements (changes) for the transition were derived using the method described in \sref{s:methods:backcasting}. \sref{s:methods:clds} explains the methodology that was used to identify the policy resistance mechanisms in the current system and, finally, \sref{s:methods:mlp-policies} explains the analytical framework used to design the policy recommendations for the transition. A graphical overview of the methodological framework is given in \fref{f:thesis-aim-methods}.
