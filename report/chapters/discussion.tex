\section[Limits of the SSP1-MOB vision]{Limits of the SSP1-MOB vision}
\label{s:discussion:limitations-ssp1-mob}
\input{sections/discussion/limitations-ssp1-mob}

\todoparagraph{
\begin{itemize}
\item normative assumptions
\item SSP1 vs SSP\{2,3,4,5\} $\rightarrow$ what would happen?
\item \textit{realistic} vs \textit{idealistic} approaches: ``it's the backcasting, stupid!''; i.e., backcasting from a vision cannot pretend to be realistic. This is in clear contrast to the common setting for scientific research, which is based in forecasting methodologies.
\end{itemize}

\section[Missing features in the AUTOLOCK model]{Missing features in the AUTOLOCK model}
\label{s:discussion:missing-features-autolock}
\input{sections/discussion/missing-features-autolock}

\todoparagraph{\begin{itemize}
\item lack of ``fuels'' perspective and other technological aspects
\item lack of transition-management features (really? or is it done on another level, above the model?)
\item lack of other perspectives, due to (a) lack of time and (b) the fact that a ``complete'' model is out of scope and reach for this thesis.
\end{itemize}}

\section[Quantitative analysis]{Quantitative analysis}
\label{s:discussion:quantitative-analysis}
\input{sections/discussion/quantitative-analysis}

\todoparagraph{\begin{itemize}
\item lack of quantitative figures for both the narrative/backcasting portion of the results and the CLD
\item lack of simulation analysis to assess the extent and pace of change in the dynamic feedback structure of the system
\end{itemize}}
