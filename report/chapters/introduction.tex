\chapter{Introduction}
\label{c:introduction}

This thesis report is an investigation of sustainable mobility futures. It is a theoretical exploration of how policy can deliver the necessary efforts and guidelines for a successful a transition to a sustainable mobility system. \emph{What} is understood for ``sustainable'' and \emph{how} the transition is to be managed and envisioned are the main foci of the document. Special emphasis is put on the \emph{cultures} of mobility and on achieving the widest \emph{system perspective} as possible. This being said, a clarification must be made already regarding a limitation in the scope of this study: the concept of ``mobility'' that is used throughout the thesis is bound to \textbf{personal travel}, i.e., not freight transport.

Overall, the report structure adheres the IMRAD+C paradigm, with the present \nameref{c:introduction} chapter, followed by the \nameref{c:methods}, \nameref{c:results}, \nameref{c:discussion} and, finally, the \nameref{c:conclusion}. With regards to this introductory chapter, \sref{s:intro:unsustainable-mobility} presents an overview of the pressing issues of the current mobility system. A state of the art review with respect to policy approaches and design tools is given in \sref{s:intro:state-of-art}. To conclude the chapter, \sref{s:intro:aim-objectives} states the aims and objectives that motivate the rest of this research.
